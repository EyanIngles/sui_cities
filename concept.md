every user owns a city, that city is a customizable NFT (choose your fields for the struct)

basically the cities as soon as it grows and shines, grants you the access to special functions
what you think? i don't want to be too specific so you can give it your touch

# cities! a game of realestate or a monolopy style game where you are to try and earn as many cities or block of land as possible. 

## concept: any user is allowed to only hold 10 objects in total. // this is depending on time.
### with holding each nft, each epoch is a currency called time and with a certain amount of time, the nft cities or land can be updraded into something with more value.

## Bonus: create a function where someone can offer their object for another object. the other use who owns the offered object must accept the offer.
